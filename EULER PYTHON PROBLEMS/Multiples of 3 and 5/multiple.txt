let's explain the code line by line:

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5(number):
    total_sum = 0
```

This line defines a function named `sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5` that takes one parameter `number`. It initializes a variable `total_sum` and sets its value to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5.

```python
    for num in range(1, number):
```

This line starts a `for` loop that iterates through a sequence of numbers generated by the `range()` function. The loop runs from `1` up to (but not including) the `number` provided as an argument to the function. For example, if `number` is `10`, the loop will iterate from `1` to `9`.

```python
        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
```
Within the `for` loop, this line checks if the current number `num` is a multiple of 3 or 5. The `%` operator calculates the remainder when `num` is divided by 3 or 5. If the remainder is 0, it means `num` is divisible by 3 or 5.

```python
            total_sum += num
```
If the current number `num` is indeed a multiple of 3 or 5 (i.e., the condition in the `if` statement is `True`), this line adds the value of `num` to the `total_sum` variable. This accumulates the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 encountered during the loop.

```python
    return total_sum
```
After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of the `total_sum`, which represents the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided `number`.

```python
# Example usage:
parameter_value = 10
result = sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5(parameter_value)
print("The sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below", parameter_value, "is:", result)
```
In this example, the code calls the `sum_of_multiples_of_3_and_5` function with `parameter_value = 10`. The function calculates the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 10 and stores the result in the variable `result`. Finally, the code prints the result, which will be `23`, as explained in the original problem statement.
